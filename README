Build Instruction:
Run make in src
CMake not quite working 100% yet

Dependancies:
SDL2, SDL2_image, tinyxml, enet (dev versions if you are compiling)
All of these are installable on ubuntu with apt-get

Major Bugs:
-Fullscreen is broken
-App will crash on start if settings.xml is not present.
-I haven't compiled hover cad in some time... need to make a Makefile

Controls:
Arrow left and right are turning; forward is jump
left shift is the gas
spacebar is the brake

Singleplayer:
make a new room; menu->Sectors->New and pick a map and wait for it to load!

Multiplayer:
the host will need to do a /host 1 to allow connections to him
the connecting players will need to /connect "the host ip address here"

Levels:
alley: old school remake of a hover race track
sumo: demo of a sumo wrestling game mode; not impleamented yet
classic 8: cool map made by Lee!

Commands:
/createroom mapname.xml     //maps should be in levels folder
/leaveroom
/closeroom
/startrace 3(or whatever)   //the laps that will be in the race
/host 1(or 0)               //start a server and allow clients to join
/connect 127.0.0.1          //connect to server
